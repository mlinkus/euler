Project Euler Solutions by M. Linkus

Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) is a collection of mathematical programming problems.
One may access a given problem by going to http://projecteuler.net/problem=XXX where XXX
is the number of the problem.

I currently have 44 of the problems solved, not all of them are included here.
These were compiled with MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/).
Please download the .DLL files to run the executables.
