Project Euler Solutions by M. Linkus

Project Euler is a collection of mathematical programming problems
found at http://www.projecteuler.net

I am currently up to 35 solutions, not all of them are included here.
These were compiled with MinGW, please download the .DLL files to run the executables.

One may access a given problem by going to http://projecteuler.net/problem=XXX where XXX is the
number of the problem, without leading zeroes.
